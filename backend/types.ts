/**
 * =============================================================================
 * UNO GAME TYPE DEFINITIONS
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * This file defines all TypeScript types used in the UNO game backend.
 * The game uses cryptographic hashing to hide card information from clients,
 * preventing cheating while maintaining game functionality.
 *
 * Key Concepts:
 * - Cards are hashed on the server to prevent clients from seeing hidden cards
 * - Player addresses are Ethereum-style wallet addresses (0x...)
 * - Game state is persisted to JSON files for crash recovery
 * - All timestamps are Unix timestamps in milliseconds
 */

// =============================================================================
// CARD TYPES
// =============================================================================

/**
 * Represents a single UNO card with its visible properties.
 *
 * @property color - The card's color: "red", "blue", "green", "yellow", or "wild"
 * @property value - The card's value: numbers (0-9) or special cards (skip, reverse, draw2, wild, draw4)
 *
 * @example
 * { color: "red", value: "5" }        // Red 5
 * { color: "blue", value: "skip" }    // Blue Skip
 * { color: "wild", value: "draw4" }   // Wild Draw Four

/**
 * A lookup table mapping cryptographic hashes to actual card objects.
 *
 * This is the "secret decoder ring" that translates hashed card references
 * into actual card information. Only the server knows these mappings.
 *
 * @property [hash: string] - Cryptographic hash as key, Card object as value
 *
 * @example
 * {
 *   "hash1": { color: "red", value: "5" },
 *   "hash2": { color: "blue", value: "7" },
 *   "hash3": { color: "green", value: "skip" }
 * }
 *
 * Why hashes?
 * - Prevents clients from seeing cards in the deck or other players' hands
 * - Clients receive "hash1" but don't know it's a Red 5 until they draw it
 * - Server-side validation ensures no cheating
